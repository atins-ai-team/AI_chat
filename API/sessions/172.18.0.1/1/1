The internal data seems to be technical information about ATINS, like faculty members, contact info, rules, and details about studying in Poland.\n\nSince the user said \"who are u,\" I need to consider if this is a follow-up after previous interactions where they might have asked questions or provided info. Without more context, it's hard to determine exactly what they're asking for. They could be introducing themselves out of habit or testing my ability to handle a new query.\n\nI should respond in a friendly and approachable way, offering further assistance based on the information available.
